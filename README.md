# RMI Demo

This repository is part of a tutorial on RMI, Remote Method Invocation.

This demo involves the following techniques:
* Spring Boot
* Docker

Note: This project has been rewritten extensively, so the docker configuration is not current anymore.

In order to start the project:

1. Maven clean install from the root of the project
2. Run RmiServerApplication in module rmi-server and wait until the application has started up
3. Run RmiClientApplication in module rmi-client

To see the application in action call:

> localhost:8081/customers/1000001

If you have questions, or suggestions, please create an issue with this repository, and I will see if I can address them.
