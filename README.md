# RMI Demo

This repository is part of a tutorial on RMI, Remote Method Invocation.

This demo involves the following techniques:
* Spring Boot
* Docker

Note: This project has been rewritten extensively, so the docker configuration is not current anymore.

If you have questions, or suggestions, please create an issue with this repository, and I will see if I can address them.
